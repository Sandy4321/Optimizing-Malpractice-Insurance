# Optimizing Malpractice Insurance

This project provides a new way to understand risk in medical malpractice insurance, using data science as a means to change the way coverage decisions are made. I worked with Austin-based malpractice insurance company to develop the prediction pipeline.

**The input**: a doctor to be evaluated. **The output**: the doctor's probability scores for each classification.

The classifiers we sought to evaluate for each doctor were **no suit**, **sued and won**, and **sued and lost**.

The status quo of the medical malpractice insurance industry is to submit an application and be evaluated for insurance by an underwriter, or a coverage specialist. The industry is ripe for disruption by way of machine learning.
