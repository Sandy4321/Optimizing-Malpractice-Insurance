# Galvanize Final Project

I am working with an Austin-based medical malpractice insurance company to optimize their coverage decision-making. Before this project, the company's coverage decision was a judgement call; ideally, a predictive algorithm trained on their current providers would be an improvement to their practices.

This project is mainly a deep-dive into an existing company's data. It aims at using data science in a practical setting in order to change the way coverage decisions are made.
